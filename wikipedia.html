            The 1992 Indian stock market scam was a market manipulation carried out by Harshad Shantilal Mehta <br> with other bankers and politicians on the Bombay Stock Exchange. The scam caused significant disruption to <br> the stock market of India, defrauding investors of over ten million USD. <br>
            
            Techniques used by Mehta involved having corrupt officials signing fake cheques, misusing market loopholes,<br> and fabrication to drive the prices of stocks up to 40 times their original price. Stock traders making good <br> returns as a result of the scam were able to fraudulently obtain unsecured loans from banks. When the scam <br> was discovered in April 1992, the Indian stock market collapsed, and the same banks</p>

        <h3>1992 Scandal</h3>
        <hr>
        <h4>overview</h4>
        <p class="p1">The scam was the biggest money market scam ever committed in India, amounting to approximately ₹ 5,000 <br> crores. The main perpetrator of the scam was a stock and money market broker Harshad Mehta. It was a <br> systematic stock scam using bank receipts and stamp paper that caused the Indian stock market to crash. <br> The scam exposed the inherent loopholes of the Indian financial systems and resulted in a completely <br> reformed system of stock transactions, including an introduction of online security systems.[1]</p>
        <p>Security frauds refer to the idea of diversion of funds from the banking system to various stockholders or 
            <br> brokers.[2] The 1992 scam was a systematic fraud committed by Mehta in the Indian stock market which led 
            <br> to the complete collapse of security systems. He committed a scam of over 1  billion from the banking system 
            <br> to buy stocks on the Bombay Stock Exchange.[3] This impacted the entire exchange system as the security 
            <br> system collapsed and investors lost hundreds of thousands of rupees in the exchange system. The scope of 
            <br> the scam was so large that the net value of the stocks was higher than the combined health and education 
            <br> budget of India. The scam was orchestrated in such a way that Mehta secured securities from the State Bank 
            <br> of India against forged cheques signed by corrupt officials and failed to deliver the securities. Mehta made the 
            <br> prices of the stocks soar high through fictitious practices and sold the stocks that he owned in these 
            <br> companies.[4] The impact of the scam had many consequences, which included the losses incurred by lakhs 
            <br> of families and the immediate crash of the stock market. The index fell from 4500 to 2500 representing a loss 
            <br> of ₹ 1000  billion in market capitalization.[2] The 1992 scam raised many questions involving bank officials <br> responsible for being in collusion with Mehta. An interview with Montek Singh Ahluwalia (Secretary, economic <br> affairs at the Ministry of Finance) revealed that many top bank officials were involved.[5]</p>

        <h3>Bank funds scam</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>In the early 70 s, banks in India were not allowed to invest in the equity markets. However, they were <br>
             expected to post profits and to retain a certain ratio (threshold) of their assets in government fixed interest <br>
              bonds. Mehta squeezed capital out of the banking system to address this requirement of banks and pumped <br>
               this money into the share market. He promised the banks higher rates of interest, while asking them to <br>
                transfer the money into his personal account, under the guise of buying securities for them from other banks. <br>
                 At that time, a bank had to go through a broker to buy securities and forward bonds from other banks. Mehta <br>
                  used this money temporarily in his account to buy shares, hike up demand of certain shares (such as that of <br>
                   ACC, Sterlite Industries, and Videocon) dramatically, sell them off, pass on a part of the proceeds to the bank <br>
                    and keep the rest for himself. This resulted in stocks like ACC, which was trading in 1991 for ₹200/share, <br>
                     catapult to nearly ₹9,000 in just 3 months.[6]</p>
                     <h3>Bank receipt scam</h3>
                     <p>Another major instrument was the bank receipt (BR). In a ready forward deal, securities were not moved back <br>
                         and forth in actuality. Instead, the borrower, i.e. the seller of securities, gave the buyer of the securities a BR. <br>
                          The BR serves as a receipt from the selling bank, and also promises that the buyer will receive the securities <br>
                           they have paid for at the end of the term. Having figured this out, Mehta needed banks, which could issue <br>
                            fake BRs, or BRs not backed by any government securities. <br>
                    

                        <br> Once these fake BRs were issued, they were passed on to other banks and the banks in turn gave money to <br>
                         Mehta, plainly assuming that they were lending against government securities when this was not really the <br>
                          case.[7] He took the price of ACC from ₹200 to ₹9,000. That was an increase of 4,400%. Since he had to <br>
                           book profits in the end, the day he sold was the day when the markets crashed.[8][9</p>
